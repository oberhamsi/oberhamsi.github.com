# first time setup

   $ git submodule init
   $ git submodule update

And to build the html site I suggest you use those settings:

   $ ./build.js -c ./site/ -b http://localhost/ringoallstar/ -o /usr/local/htdocs/ringoallstar/


  * -c input directory
  * -b base uri
  * -o output directory


# modifying/adding to the site

All markdown files in the folder ./site/ are processed using the master template "./templates/master.html" to generate the HTML files in /usr/local/htdocs/ringoallstar/

If you have a project with markdown documentation, it is fairly easy to add it. Submodule clone it into the ./external/ folder and make a symlink from site to your new project checkout.

  * git add submodule git://my/project external/myproject
  * ln -s external/myproject site/myproject
